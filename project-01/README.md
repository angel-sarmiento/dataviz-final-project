## Mini-Project 1

This is a project using Earthquake data from across the globe since early recorded human history. It involves a series of features that include, but are not limited to, `year`, `day`, etc., `deaths`, `location`, `country`, and `longitude`/`latitude`.

This mini project develops analysis on some questions posed about the data.
