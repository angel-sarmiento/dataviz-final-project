The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find a [short project](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/dataviz-final-project/blob/main/project-01/report/AS_analysis_data_viz.md) creating visualizations using some data on earthquakes. This is a project using Earthquake data from across the globe since early recorded human history. It involves a series of features that include, but are not limited to, year, day, etc., deaths, location, country, and longitude/latitude.


**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the top 100 songs and their respective albums using the Spotify API. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/the_past_decade_in_music/tree/master/reports).

## Project 03

In this [project](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/dataviz-final-project/blob/main/project-03/A_Sarmiento_project_03.md), I explored the dataset obtained from FSUâ€™s Florida Climate Center, for a station at Tampa International Airport (TPA) from 2016 to 2017.

### Moving Forward

I learned how to make interactive and spatial visualizations, refined my data wrangling skills, and worked more with APIs. In the future, I would like to explore developing dashboards and refining my website to include a lot of these projects.
