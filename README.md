The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find a [short project](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/dataviz-final-project/blob/main/project-01/report/AS_analysis_data_viz.md) creating visualizations using some data on earthquakes. This is a project using Earthquake data from across the globe since early recorded human history. It involves a series of features that include, but are not limited to, year, day, etc., deaths, location, country, and longitude/latitude.
